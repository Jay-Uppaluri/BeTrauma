Be  Trauma - Trauma informed care. 

This app is designed to be an accessible version of the Be Trauma I.N.F.O.R.M.E.D toolkit, a novel evidence-based toolkit used to train internal medicine residents in trauma-informed care practices, especially in the inpatient setting. For the purposes of our pilot study in 2025, please only download and access if you are confirmed to be in the experimental arm. For any questions, please contact us at revika.singh@northwestern.edu (mailto:revika.singh@northwestern.edu)
